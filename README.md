This project follows a tutorial provided by Corey Schafer for the implementation of a blog web application using Python/Django.  I've had a personal interest in exploring the Python language further and wanted to dive into something that also included databases, user authentication, GUI's, and popular frameworks regularly used in industry today.  For anyone else looking for similar experience, Schafer has been an amazing resource outside of the usual academic curriculum and I can't recommend him enough.  You can find him here: https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5/about

More documentation and updates to follow.
